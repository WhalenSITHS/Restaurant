4 – No side

Desserts:

The program should take as input a number for each menu item, compute the total cost of the meal, and print it out. The first line of input will be the customer's choice of entree, the second line will be the customer's choice of drink, the third line will be the customer's choice of side, and the fourth line will be the customer's choice of dessert
